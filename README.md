# Flashcard-o-matic_Project
Flashcard-o-matic is a web application that allows users to create, study, view, delete and edit flashcards.
It is intended to be used not just by teachers and students, but as a way for anyone to learn and memorize their topic of choice.
This is my frontend capstone project with [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/).
