# Flashcard-o-matic_Project
Flashcard-o-matic is a web application that allows users to create, study, view, delete and edit flashcards.
It is intended to be used not just by teachers and students, but as a way for anyone to learn and memorize their topic of choice.
This is my frontend capstone project with [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/).

## Screenshots
### Home Page
The home screen displays a "Create Deck" button, the currently available flashcard decks, and the option to "View," "Study," or delete a deck.

### View Deck
Clicking the "view" button leads to the deck screen where the user can view all cards contained in the deck. There are options to edit, study, delete or add cards to the deck, as well as edit or delete individual cards.

### Study Deck
Clicking the "study" button leads to the chosen deck's study screen. The front side of the first card in the deck is displayed first, and the user can then flip to the back of the card and click "next" to move on. At the end of the deck, the browser window prompts the user to either restart the deck or return to the home page.

### Edit Deck/Card
Clicking "edit" under the chosen deck or card leads to a form prefilled with information from the deck/card. The user can edit the info, and clicking "Submit" leads back to the deck page.

### Delete Prompt
Clicking any of the trashcan icons brings up a prompt in the browser, verifying if the user wants to delete the deck or card.
